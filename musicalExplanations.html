    Welcome to the "musical explanations page". I'm definitely not done writing yet and am planning on adding
    some better descriptions. This is currently just a very brief overview. Check back here in the future for more.

    <p style="margin-top: 2em;"> Musical Model for Conditionals </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    When a have a group of conditional statements, the `if` statement condition is evaluated first. If that condition
    isn’t true, then it moves to the `elif/else` statements. </li>

    <li>
    Each time we evaluate a condition, a musical motif is played. As we move through the list of conditionals, the
    musical motif modulates up by a perfect 4th. The decision about that interval was somewhat arbitrary, somewhat
    not. I figured that I couldn’t just pick a completely random interval because that might sound terrible. I decided
    on perfect 4ths because the current key signature will only differ by 1 accidental (because they’re adjacent on
    the Circle of Fifths/Fourths). </li>

    <li>
    The motif ends on a minor 7th scale degree, and it’s meant to sound “unresolved”, as we haven’t found a
    condition that’s true yet. The modulation parallels an increasing sense of anticipation to arrive at a
    statement that we can execute. </li>

    <li>
    At `else`, we play a motif that resolves back to the original key and the root, because the condition is
    now “resolved”, as we have gone through every other condition and have finally arrived at the end. </li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-top: 2em;"> Stack frame harmonics </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each time a new stack frame is added, add a new harmonic to the overall sound</li>
      <li>When a stack frame is finished and is taken off the stack, remove that harmonic </li>
      <li>Represents the program in a different area of memory at different points in time: harmonics give the
    sound a different timbre </li>
      <li>Harmonics on top of each other are all different notes (parallel: different spaces in higher/lower memory), but together,
    they are different parts of a single sound (parallel: when there are a lot of stack frames, at any given time, all stack
    frames below the current one play a part in shaping the execution of the same program)</li>
    </ul>
