    Hi! I’m glad that you stumbled upon my project. Read on for more info!

    <h3 id="about"> A B O U T </h3>
    <p> <a href="https://codaphone-python.github.io" target="_blank">Codaphone</a>
      is my ICAM Senior Project, which I completed to fulfill a 2-quarter-long
      project sequence required for graduation as an
      <a href="https://music-cms.ucsd.edu/ugrad/icam-major.html" target="_blank">ICAM major</a>
      at UC San Diego. </p>
    <p> The word “Codaphone” is a play on the musical term “coda”, the word “code”, and the Greek
      root “phon”. In music, a “coda” represents a passage that you play at the end. Seems pretty
      fitting, as this is the last thing I need to complete to finish my degree! “Code” because
      the user inputs code, and “phon” (which means "sound") because it makes sounds.
      (special thanks to Prof Shlomo Dubnov for coming up with this name) </p>
    <p> Throughout my undergrad, I became fascinated with computer programs and the ways that people
      understand them. Particularly, it’s really interesting to think about ways to build on people’s
      mental models of these concepts and represent them in more tangible ways. </p>
    <p> When people first learn programming, they are often taught to draw diagrams that represent
      their code. These visually-based models are generally very effective, and I thought that it
      would be interesting to build off of these models and represent programs using sounds. Ideally,
      the auditory elements will add to the sensory experience and will be helpful in reinforcing
      people’s understanding of the code. </p>
    <p> Even if this doesn’t help with any kind of learning or understanding, it’s still pretty cool
      to have some sort of piece of “music” that represents the code as it runs! As far as I know,
      no one else has done that yet. It could be fun to just experiment with different programs to
      try to make different sounds. </p>
    <p> If you’re interested, I also wrote a lot about some of the specific musical reasonings
      for the sounds that I used. Read about it
      <a href="musicalExplanations.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
      Maybe you’ll learn something about music theory! </p>

    <p> Similar to <a href="https://pythontutor.com" target="_blank">Python Tutor</a> (which, to some
      extent, gave me the idea for this project), Codaphone is
      not meant to be used for very long or complicated programs. Here are some things that I don’t plan
      to add functionality for. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Classes and objects </li>
      <li> Inputs from stdin </li>
      <li> Importing libraries </li>
      <li> Functions defined inside functions </li>
      <li> Function overloading </li>
      <li> Concatenating strings by placing them next to each other </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="known_bugs"> K N O W N _ B U G S </h3>
    <p> We will probably continue to find things that can be improved. If you notice something that’s
      not on this list, you can <a href="https://forms.gle/QfctNzRknjHyqxP39" target="_blank">submit
        a bug report</a>. These are the ones that I know of that I do hope to fix eventually. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> A comment at the end of a line won’t be removed before the evaluation </li>
      <li> A string literal that contains “\n” will mess things up </li>
      <li> for loops not implemented </li>
      <li> Dictionaries not implemented </li>
      <li> +=, -=, *=, etc. not implemented </li>
      <li> List literals inside list literals, list literals as arguments to functions </li>
      <li> When a numeric literal is on the left side of the comparison operator, it's not
              evaluated as a boolean expression (ex: x = 5 < 7)</li>
      <li> When a boolean expression is short-circuited and the remainder of the expression
              is not a boolean literal, the line is not updated correctly </li>
      <li> Returning from a function inside a conditional statement or a loop </li>
    </ul>
